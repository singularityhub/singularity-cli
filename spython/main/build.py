       image, builder = Client.build(...)

       Parameters
       ==========

       recipe: the path to the recipe file (or source to build from). If not
                  defined, we look for "Singularity" file in $PWD
       image: the image to build (if None, will use arbitary name
       isolated: if True, run build with --isolated flag
       sandbox: if True, create a writable sandbox
       writable: if True, use writable ext3 (sandbox takes preference)
       build_folder: where the container should be built.
       ext: the image extension to use.
       robot_name: boolean, default False. if you don't give your image a 
                   name (with "image") then a fun robot name will be generated
                   instead. Highly recommended :) 
       sudo: give sudo to the command (or not) default is True for build
