class Recipe:

    a recipe includes an environment, labels, runscript or command,
    and install sequence. This object is interacted with by a Parser
    (intended to popualte the recipe with content) and a Writer (intended
    to write a recipe to file). The parsers and writers are located in
    parsers.py, and writers.py, respectively. The user is also free to use
    the recipe class to build recipes.

    Parameters
    ==========
    recipe: the original recipe file, parsed by the subclass either
            DockerParser or SingularityParser
    layer: the count of the layer, for human readability
