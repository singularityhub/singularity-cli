    Parameters
    ==========

    image: full path to singularity image
    command: command to send to container
    app: if not None, execute a command in context of an app
    writable: This option makes the file system accessible as read/write
    contain: This option disables the automatic sharing of writable
             filesystems on your host
    options: an optional list of options to provide to execute.
    singularity_options: a list of options to provide to the singularity client
    bind: list or single string of bind paths.
         This option allows you to map directories on your host system to
         directories within your container using bind mounts
    nv: if True, load Nvidia Drivers in runtime (default False)
    return_result: if True, return entire json object with return code
                   and message result not (default)
    quiet: Do not print verbose output.
    environ: extra environment to add.
