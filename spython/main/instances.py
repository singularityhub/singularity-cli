    Since we expect json output, we don't support older versions of Singularity.

    ==========
    return_json: return a json list of instances instead of objects (False)
    name: if defined, return the list for just one instance (used to ged pid)
    singularity_options: a list of options to provide to the singularity client

    Return Code  --   Reason
    0 -- Instances Found
    1 -- No Instances, libexecdir value not found, functions file not found
    255 -- Couldn't get UID
