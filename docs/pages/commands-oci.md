This section will discussion interaction with the OCI command group, new to
Singularity 3.1.0. If you are using versions of Singularity before this,
you won't be able to use these functions. If you want to learn more about OCI,
see [opencontainers.org](https://opencontainers.org).

 - [background](#background): some quick background on the OCI runtime spec
 - [setup](#setup): create a bundle folder with a config.json to drive it

 - [create](#create): create an OCI image using the client

The commands for state, kill, pause, resume, etc. will be discussed in context
of the above.

# Background

To give you some quick background, the [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) of the open container initiative (OCI), you'll see that it defines a way
to create a container from something called a "bundle"

## What is a bundle?

A bundle is just a folder on your computer with the contents of an operating system,
libraries, and software, along with a configuration file (config.json). The
configuration file conforms to this "runtime specification," and generally
 describes permissions, binds, environment, and other runtime variables for the
container.

## Why do we have this specification?

It might seem silly, but what this runtime specification is a standard set of
terms for generating and interacting with containers. What does this mean in
practice? We can have tools and infrastructure (for example, Kubernetes, a container
orchestration system) that know how to interact with many different kinds of containers.
How? Because they implement the OCI specification, and the communication is standardized.

# Usage

## Install

If you haven't yet installed Singularity Python:

```bash
$ pip install spython
```

or see [the install docs](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/install) for different variants of that.


## Setup

Now that you are familiar with the idea of a bundle, let's:

 - create a folder with an operating system
 - add a config.json template there
 - create an OCI Image with the Singularity Python client

We will do these steps before all of the "Create" examples below.
First, open up an ipython shell. You can use `spython shell` to get one
loaded with a client.

```bash
spython shell
```

Once in ipython, let's use Singularity build with sandbox to dump a busybox
base operating system into a temporary folder. Singularity Python also
will provide you with a dummy (limited) configuration file) to use to test.

```python
from spython.utils import get_installdir

# Here is the dummy config.json for you!
config = "%s/oci/config.json" % get_installdir()

# Let's now build a bundle into /tmp/bundle
image = client.build("docker://busybox:1.30.1",
                     image='/tmp/bundle',
                     sandbox=True,
                     sudo=False)
```

If you need to import the client on your own (if you don't use spython shell)

```bash
from spython.main import Client as client
```

Next, copy the config to your bundle folder.

```python
import shutil
shutil.copyfile(config, '%s/config.json' % image)
```

Now that you have your bundle and config.json file, you can create an Oci Image
from it.


## Quick Start

The quickest way to create a running Oci Image from a bundle is to
instantiate an OciImage instance. If you didn't import the client, do
that now:

```python
from spython.main import Client as client
```

Here is the OciImage object to instantiate! Notice that we are providing
the full path to the bundle folder, along with an id for our container.

```python
$ image = client.oci.OciImage(bundle='/tmp/bundle',
                              container_id='figbars')
[singularity-python-oci:figbars]
```

The variable "image" now holds a complete OciImage class (not attached to the client)
and with "mycontainer" set as the container_id. If you are in ipython and press TAB,
you will see all the expected functions.

```bash
attach()           execute()          mount()            resume()
 container_id       get_container_id() OciImage           RobotNamer
 create()           get_uri()          parse_image_name() run()
 delete()           kill()             remove_uri()       run_command()
```

It's created off the bat! And further, the container id you defined is stored
with the object, so you don't need to ask for it again.

```python
image.state()

{'attachSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/figbars/attach.sock',
 'bundle': '/tmp/bundle',
 'controlSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/figbars/control.sock',
 'createdAt': 1551744400481853703,
 'id': 'figbars',
 'ociVersion': '1.0.1-dev',
 'pid': 20854,
 'status': 'created'}
```

Here is the stored container id:

```python
image.container_id
'figbars'
```

And we can see that the default is that sudo is used to create it:

```python
image.sudo
True
```

By default, if you don't provide a bundle directory it won't be created.

```python
$ image = client.oci.OciImage(container_id='figbars')
```

This would be a good way to get a handle for an (already created) image, or
something you are otherwise not ready to create. You can also explicitly tell the function not to create the image.

```python
$ image = client.oci.OciImage(bundle='/tmp/bundle',
                              container_id='figbars',
                              create=False)
```


From this point on, you can interact with your image via this object. The
commands that will be discussed below are available to you. Press TAB
after typing "image." to see the options:

```python
In [39]: image.
 attach()           debug              get_uri()          parse_image_name()
 bundle             delete()           kill()             quiet
 container_id       execute()          mount()            remove_uri()       >
 create()           get_container_id() OciImage           resume()
```

Give everything a test!  For example, try executing a command to your image:

```python
result = image.execute(command=["ls","/"])
print(result)
bin
boot
cdrom
dev
etc
home
initrd.img
initrd.img.old
lib
lib32
lib64
lost+found
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
test
tmp
usr
var
vmlinuz
vmlinuz.old
```

You can then clean up.

```python
image.pause()
# or
image.kill()
image.delete()
```


## Create

Let's discuss another option for create - one that also starts from our
bundle folder, but instead just uses the client to interact with it (without directly creating an instance). Here is how to create it:

```python
metadata = client.oci.create(bundle=image, container_id='robot-man')
```

As of 3.1.0, the command above does require sudo, so it will prompt you for it
unless you already have effective user id as 0. The return of the above will be a json object that describes metadata for the container, the same that we saw above
when we asked for the `image.state()`.

```python
{'attachSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/robot-man/attach.sock',
 'bundle': '/tmp/bundle',
 'controlSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/robot-man/control.sock',
 'createdAt': 1551744049459537512,
 'id': 'robot-man',
 'ociVersion': '1.0.1-dev',
 'pid': 20602,
 'status': 'created'}
```

Notice that the status is "created." If you wanted to get this result again with
the client:


```bash
$ client.oci.state('robot-man', sudo=True)

{'attachSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/robot-man/attach.sock',
 'bundle': '/tmp/bundle',
 'controlSocket': '/var/run/singularity/instances/root/robot-man/control.sock',
 'createdAt': 1551744049459537512,
 'id': 'robot-man',
 'ociVersion': '1.0.1-dev',
 'pid': 20602,
 'status': 'created'}
```

*important* notice how we included sudo=True with the above - since we created
the Oci Image with sudo, it lives in root's space. If we call without sudo, or
ask for the state of a non existing container, we will get None for a result.

```
$ client.oci.state('doesntexist')

# No sudo
$ client.oci.state('mycontainer')
```

Both of the above return no result (None).

We haven't gone through all of the examples, but if you would like a specific example
