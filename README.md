Singularity Python (spython) is the Python API for working with <a href="sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/" target="_blank">Singularity</a> containers. See
the [documentation](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli) for installation and usage, and
the [install instructions](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/install) for a quick start.

We provide a [Singularity](Singularity) recipe for you to use if more convenient, along with the [full modules docstring](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/api/source/spython.main.base.html#module-spython.main.base).

As of version 0.1.0, we only support Singularity > 3.5.2. This is done to encourage using
newer versions of Singularity with security fixes. If you want to use an older version of Singularity,
you will need to use version 0.0.85 or earlier.
